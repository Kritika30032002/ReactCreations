## What does this app do?

- It is a clone of YouTube HomePage and SearchPage.
- HomePage displays the most popular videos of the selected country by querying data from the YouTube API.
- HomePage utilizes infinite-scroll feature, so new videos thumbnails will load when the user keeps scrolling down the page.
- Typing a word and clicking on search does a real search on YouTube API, 25 results are displayed on the SearchPage.

## What is this project about?

- This is mainly a material-ui and styled-components learning project. I aimed at making the website look as close to the original YouTube as possible.
- This project ends up turning into a state and complexity management exercise too because as the project progressed, I realized it is much bigger than I thought.

## What technologies were used?

- react.js (create-react-app)
- react-router
- axios
- styled-components
- Material-UI v4
