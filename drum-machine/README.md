# Drum Machine

**Description:**

Welcome to my Drum Machine App, part of my journey in completing the Front End Development Libraries certificate on FreeCodeCamp. The project was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.

## Project Overview

This interactive drum machine allows users to unleash their creativity by playing with 9 dynamic drum pads, each producing unique sounds. With two distinct banks, users can toggle between Trap and LoFi drum sound banks.

## Features

- **Bank Selection:** Switch between two banks of sounds - Trap and LoFi - each comprising 9 different drum sounds.
- **Display Screen:** An LCD screen visually indicates the currently selected sound.
- **Power Button:** The power button allows you to control the on/off state of the drum machine.
- **Volume Slider:** Adjust the volume of the drum machine with the volume slider.
