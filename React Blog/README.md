## Configuration

1. Create a Firebase project: [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

Replace `your-api-key`, `your-auth-domain`, etc., with your Firebase project credentials.

```bash
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to access the blog website.
