2. Clone your new fork of the repository in the terminal/CLI on your computer:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/firstspot
    ```

3. Navigate to the newly created `firstspot` project directory:

    ```bash
    cd firstspot
    ```

4. Set upstream command:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/jaysomani/firstspot
    ```

5. Create a new branch:

    git checkout -b YourBranchName
    ```

6. Sync your fork or your local repository with the origin repository:

    - In your forked repository, click on "Fetch upstream"

    ```bash
    git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
    ```

9. Push your local commits to the remote repository:
