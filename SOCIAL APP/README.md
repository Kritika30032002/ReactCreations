## Introduction

Our Social App is a modern and interactive platform that allows users to connect, share posts, and engage with others in a social network environment. It is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Features

### 1. Like and Dislike Posts

Users can express their feelings towards posts by liking or disliking them. This feature enhances user engagement and interaction within the community.

### 2. Multiple Pages (Pagination)

The app supports multiple pages to efficiently display a large number of posts. Pagination is implemented to help users navigate through different pages seamlessly, making it easy to explore and discover new content.

### 3. React Router DOM

We have utilized the React Router DOM library to enable seamless navigation and create a smooth user experience. Users can easily transition between different sections of the app, such as the main feed, chat pages, and notifications.

### 4. User Profile Page

Each user has a dedicated profile page where they can showcase their details, view their own posts, and manage their account settings. This feature enhances personalization and allows users to curate their online presence.
