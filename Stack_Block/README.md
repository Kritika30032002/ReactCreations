# stackr

Stackr is a block stacking game created using three.js, react-three-fiber, react-three-drei, and GSAP. The game features physics emulation via cannon.js and saves the highscore on localStorage. The objective of the game is to stack blocks on top of each other until there is no area left to stack on.
