### 'Game OverView'

In the Dice Game, you will roll a standard six-sided die to accumulate points. The objective is to reach the highest score you can by rolling the dice. The game will keep track of your score, and you can choose to roll the dice as many times as you like. Be careful, though, as rolling a 1 will reset your score to zero, and your turn ends.
